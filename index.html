      Hey, my name is Okikiola, I’ve dropped out of software engineering three
      times. Each time, I thought that was it. But here I am, trying again but
      this time with a focus on Cloud Engineering. I’m learning at AltSchool
      Africa, I am part of the Baraka Cohort, and this site is where I’m
      documenting my journey, starting from Month 2.

      I’m not here to be perfect, just to prove to myself (and maybe someone
      else out there) that it’s okay to start over. That you can come back after
      failure, and still build something that matters
